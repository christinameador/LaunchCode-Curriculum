    <p>As a web designer I have the power to do big things. I can connect people, friends, families, I can make them happy, give them something to do before they fall asleep, I can make things that only God could. Internet is the greatest way to share ideas for millions of people, making them smarter and giving them the opportunity to understand and respect other ideas. Rich web applications make all this easier and leave the programmer with an invaluable feeling of satisfaction.</p>
